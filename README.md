# ARAM Stats
#### Do you love League of Legends, but only play ARAM (All-Random-All-Mid) mode most of the time? Ever wonder how good you are at ARAM, but just don't know where to look for it?

#### Most popular LoL stats tracker only give you records and analysis on your ranked/normal games, but none is made solely for ARAM games...until now

### Welcome to ARAM Stats
#### This is where you can keep track of your ARAM-centric scores, where we will give you the ultimate stats break down for all your random goodness.

### How to utilize this app
To use this web app, you must have an active League of Legends account (create account/download the game here: https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/index?realm_key=na). Due to the fact that Riot Games API only provides game match history for Ranked Queues, I can only search as far back as the last 10 games that you played, and I only extract the game data that's played with ARAM queue. Therefore, if you didn't play any ARAM games during your last 10 games, you won't see any data. However, once you start checking your data, any new result will be counted towards your stats summary. Once you understand the limitation of this application, please feel free to type in your own summoner name and check out how your ARAM stats compare! 

### What's it built with?
ARAM Stats is built with nodeJS, expressJS, and Socket.io on the Server side; PostgreSQL as the database; and AngularJS on the Client side.
